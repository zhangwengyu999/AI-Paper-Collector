We focus on mixed (discrete and continuous) data and introduce AimNet, an attention-based learning network for missing data imputation. AimNet utilizes a variation of the dot product attention mechanism to learn interpretable, structural properties of the mixed data distribution and relies on the learned structure to perform imputation. We perform an extensive experimental study over 14 real-world data sets to understand the role of attention and structure on data imputation. We find that the simple attention-based architecture of AimNet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, such as ensemble tree models and deep learning architectures (e.g., generative adversarial networks), by up to 43% in accuracy on discrete values and up to 26.7% in normalized-RMS error on continuous values. A key finding of our study is that, by learning the structure of the underlying distribution, the attention mechanism can generalize better on systematically-missing data where imputation requires reasoning about functional relationships between attributes.",

We develop a new system to optimally solve the problem in reasonable times (under an hour) using off-the-shelf MILP solvers. These schedules subsequently accelerate millions of training iterations.

To fit within the memory and computational limitations of resource-constrained edge-devices,  we exploit mixed low-bitwidth compression, featuring 8, 4 or 2-bit uniform quantization, and we model the inference graph with integer-only operations. \nOur approach aims at determining the minimum bit precision of every activation and weight tensor given the memory constraints of a device. This is achieved through a rule-based iterative procedure, which cuts the number of bits of the most memory-demanding layers, aiming at meeting the memory constraints. After a quantization-aware retraining step, the fake-quantized graph is converted into an inference integer-only model by inserting the Integer Channel-Normalization (ICN) layers, which introduce a negligible loss as demonstrated on INT4 MobilenetV1 models. We report the latency-accuracy evaluation of mixed-precision MobilenetV1 family networks on a STM32H7 microcontroller. Our experimental results demonstrate an end-to-end deployment of an integer-only Mobilenet network with Top1 accuracy of 68% on a device with only 2MB of FLASH memory and 512kB of RAM, improving by 8% the Top1 accuracy with respect to previously published 8 bit implementations for microcontrollers.",

In this work, we introduce a framework, FedProx, to tackle heterogeneity in federated networks. FedProx can be viewed as a generalization and re-parametrization of FedAvg, the current state-of-the-art method for federated learning. While this re-parameterization makes only minor modifications to the method itself, these modifications have important ramifications both in theory and in practice. Theoretically, we provide convergence guarantees for our framework when learning over data from non-identical distributions (statistical heterogeneity), and while adhering to device-level systems constraints by allowing each participating device to perform a variable amount of work (systems heterogeneity). Practically, we demonstrate that FedProx allows for more robust convergence than FedAvg across a suite of realistic federated datasets. In particular, in highly heterogeneous settings, FedProx demonstrates significantly more stable and accurate convergence behavior relative to FedAvg\u2014improving absolute test accuracy by 18.8% on average.",

However, in the context of training deep learning models, the commonly used back-propagation (BP) algorithm imposes a strong sequential dependency in the process of gradient computation. Under model parallelism, BP has a theoretical step complexity of Theta(n) which hinders its scalability in a parallel computing environment, where n represents the number of compute devices into which a model is partitioned.\nScan is a primitive operation that performs an in-order aggregation on a sequence of values and returns the partial result at each step. Parallel algorithms (e.g., Blelloch scan) have been developed to scale the scan operation on massively parallel systems. In this work, in order to improve the scalability of BP, we reformulate BP into a scan operation which is then scaled by our modified version of the Blelloch scan algorithm with a theoretical step complexity of Theta(log n). We evaluate our approach on a vanilla Recurrent Neural Network training with synthetic datasets, and demonstrate up to 2.75x speedup in terms of the overall training time and 8.8x speedup on the backward pass alone.",

Data sharing strategy, however, performs poorly for a heterogeneous set of DNNs where each DNN has varying computational needs and thus different training rate and convergence speed. This paper proposes FLEET, a flexible ensemble DNN training framework for efficiently training a heterogeneous set of DNNs. We build FLEET via several technical innovations. We theoretically prove that an optimal resource allocation is NP-hard and propose a greedy algorithm to efficiently allocate resources for training each DNN with data sharing. We integrate data-parallel DNN training into ensemble training to mitigate the differences in training rates. We introduce checkpointing into this context to address the issue of different convergence speeds. Experiments show that FLEET significantly improves the training efficiency of DNN ensembles without compromising the quality of the result.",

However, training neural network ensembles requires a large amount of computational resources and time. State-of-the-art approaches either train all networks from scratch leading to prohibitive training cost or generate ensembles by training a monolithic architecture resulting in lower diversity and accuracy. We propose MotherNets to address these shortcomings: A MotherNet captures the structural similarity across different members of a deep neural network ensemble. To train an ensemble, we first train a single or a small set of MotherNets and subsequently, their function is transferred to all members of the ensemble. Then, we continue to train the ensemble networks, which converge significantly faster compared to training from scratch. MotherNets can handle ensembles with diverse architectures by clustering ensemble networks of similar architecture and training a separate MotherNet for every cluster. MotherNets also use clustering to balance the accuracy vs. training cost tradeoff. We show that compared to state-of-the-art approaches such as Snapshot ensembles, knowledge distillation, and TreeNets, MotherNets can achieve better accuracy given the same time budget or alternatively that MotherNets can achieve the same accuracy as state-of-the-art approaches at a fraction of the training time.  Overall, we demonstrate that MotherNets bring not only performance and accuracy improvements but a new powerful way to balance the training cost vs. accuracy tradeoff and we verify these benefits over numerous state-of-the-art neural network architectures.",

It is therefore important to accurately predict per-user feature usage in order to minimize wasted precomputation (an approach we call \u201cpredictive precompute\u201d). In this paper, we describe the novel application of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for predictive precompute.

Winograd convolutions are the fastest known algorithm for spatially small convolutions, but exploiting their full potential comes with the burden of numerical error, rendering them unusable in quantized contexts. In this work we propose a Winograd-aware formulation of convolution layers which exposes the numerical inaccuracies introduced by the Winograd transformations to the learning of the model parameters, enabling the design of competitive quantized models without impacting model size. We also address the source of the numerical error and propose a relaxation on the form of the transformation matrices, resulting in up to 10% higher classification accuracy on CIFAR-10. Finally, we propose wiNAS, a neural architecture search (NAS) framework that jointly optimizes a given macro-architecture for accuracy and latency leveraging Winograd-aware layers.

Centralized CBA agents utilize potentially sensitive data from recent interactions to provide personalization to end-users. Keeping the sensitive data locally, by running a local agent on the user's device, protects the user's privacy, however, the agent requires longer to produce useful recommendations, as it does not leverage feedback from other users.\nThis paper proposes a technique we call Privacy-Preserving Bandits (P2B); a system that updates local agents by collecting feedback from other local agents in a differentially-private manner. Comparisons of our proposed approach with a non-private, as well as a fully-private (local) system, show competitive performance on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world data. Specifically, we observed only a decrease of 2.6% and 3.6% in multi-label classification accuracy, and a CTR increase of 0.0025 in online advertising for a privacy budget \u03b5 \u2248 0.693. These results suggest P2B is an effective approach to challenges arising in on-device privacy-preserving personalization.",

These designs are especially effective while designing neural architectures under hard resource constraints (memory, MACs, . . . ) which highlights the importance of this class of designing neural networks. However, such a move creates complication in the previously streamlined pattern of execution. In fact one of the main challenges is that the order of such nodes in the neural network significantly effects the memory footprint of the intermediate activations. Current compilers do not schedule with regard to activation memory footprint that it significantly increases its peak compared to the optimum, rendering it not applicable for edge devices. To address this standing issue, we present a memory-aware compiler, dubbed SERENITY, that utilizes dynamic programming to find a sequence that finds a schedule with optimal memory footprint. Our solution also comprises of graph rewriting technique that allows further reduction beyond the optimum. As such, SERENITY achieves optimal peak memory, and the graph rewriting technique further improves this resulting in 1.68\u00d7 improvement with dynamic programming-based scheduler and 1.86\u00d7 with graph rewriting, against TensorFlow Lite with less than one minute overhead.",

While object detection is one of the most compute-intensive tasks from the artificial intelligence domain, it is only allowed to use limited computation and memory resources on embedded devices. In the meanwhile, such resource-constrained implementations are often required to satisfy additional demanding requirements such as real-time response, high-throughput performance, and reliable inference accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose SkyNet, a hardware-efficient method to deliver the state-of-the-art detection accuracy and speed for embedded systems. Instead of following the common top-down flow for compact DNN design, SkyNet provides a bottom-up DNN design approach with comprehensive understanding of the hardware constraints at the very beginning to deliver hardware-efficient DNNs. The effectiveness of SkyNet is demonstrated by winning the extremely competitive System Design Contest for low power object detection in the 56th IEEE/ACM Design Automation Conference (DAC-SDC), where our SkyNet significantly outperforms all other 100+ competitors: it delivers 0.731 Intersection over Union (IoU) and 67.33 frames per second (FPS) on a TX2 embedded GPU; and 0.716 IoU and 25.05 FPS on an Ultra96 embedded FPGA. The evaluation of SkyNet is also extended to GOT-10K, a recent large-scale high-diversity benchmark for generic object tracking in the wild. For state-of-the-art object trackers SiamRPN++ and SiamMask, where ResNet-50 is employed as the backbone, implementations using our SkyNet as the backbone DNN are 1.60X and 1.73X faster with better or similar accuracy when running on a 1080Ti GPU, and 37.20X smaller in terms of parameter size for significantly better memory and storage footprint.",

Our extensive empirical results show that ASHA outperforms existing state-of-the-art hyperparameter optimization methods; scales linearly with the number of workers in distributed settings; and is suitable for massive parallelism, converging to a high quality configuration in half the time taken by Vizier (Google\u2019s internal hyperparameter optimization service) in an experiment with 500 workers.

This retraining exacerbates a large challenge facing ML systems today: model training is unstable, i.e., small changes in training data can cause significant changes in the model's predictions. In this paper, we work on developing a deeper understanding of this instability, with a focus on how a core building block of modern natural language processing (NLP) pipelines---pre-trained word embeddings---affects the instability of downstream NLP models. We first empirically reveal a tradeoff between stability and memory: increasing the embedding memory 2x can reduce the disagreement in predictions due to small changes in training data by 5% to 39% (relative). To theoretically explain this tradeoff, we introduce a new measure of embedding instability---the eigenspace instability measure. We relate the eigenspace instability measure to downstream instability by proving a bound on the disagreement in downstream predictions introduced by the change in word embeddings. Practically, we show that the eigenspace instability measure can be a cost-effective way to choose embedding parameters to minimize instability without training downstream models, achieving up to 3.71x lower error rates than existing embedding distance measures. Finally, we demonstrate that the observed stability-memory tradeoffs extend to other types of embeddings as well, including knowledge graph and contextual word embeddings.",

To get around the costly computations associated with large models and data, the community is increasingly investing in specialized hardware for model training. However, specialized hardware is expensive and hard to generalize to a multitude of tasks. The progress on the algorithmic front has failed to demonstrate a direct advantage over powerful hardware such as NVIDIA-V100 GPUs. This paper provides an exception. We propose SLIDE (Sub-LInear Deep learning Engine) that uniquely blends smart randomized algorithms, with multi-core parallelism and workload optimization. Using just a CPU, SLIDE drastically reduces the computations during both training and inference outperforming an optimized implementation of Tensorflow (TF) on the best available GPU. Our evaluations on industry-scale recommendation datasets, with large fully connected architectures, show that training with SLIDE on a 44 core CPU is more than 3.5 times (1 hour vs. 3.5 hours) faster than the same network trained using TF on Tesla V100 at any given accuracy level. On the same CPU hardware, SLIDE is over 10x faster than TF. We provide codes and scripts for reproducibility.",

Salus is an efficient, consolidated execution service\nthat exposes the GPU to different DL applications, and enforces fine-grained sharing by performing iteration\nscheduling and addressing associated memory management issues. We show that these primitives can then be\nused to implement flexible sharing policies for various use cases. Our integration of Salus with TensorFlow and\nevaluation on popular DL jobs shows that Salus can improve the average completion time of DL training jobs by\n3.19\u00d7, GPU utilization for hyper-parameter tuning by 2.38\u00d7, and GPU utilization of DL inference applications\nby 42\u00d7 over not sharing the GPU and 7\u00d7 over NVIDIA MPS with small overhead.",

However, they typically\nuse techniques designed for conventional data serving workloads,\nmissing critical opportunities to leverage the statistical nature of ML inference.\nIn this paper, we present OptX, an optimizer for ML inference\nthat introduces two statistically-motivated optimizations\ntargeting ML applications whose performance bottleneck is feature computation.\nFirst, OptX automatically cascades feature computation.\nOptX classifies most data inputs using only high-value, low-cost features selected by a dataflow analysis\nalgorithm and cost model, improving performance by up to 5x without \nstatistically significant accuracy loss.\nSecond, OptX accurately approximates ML top-K queries,\ndiscarding low-scoring inputs with an automatically constructed approximate model then\nranking the remainder with a more powerful model, improving performance by up to 10x with minimal accuracy loss.\nBoth optimizations automatically tune their own parameters to maximize performance while meeting a target accuracy level. \nOptX combines these novel optimizations with powerful compiler optimizations\nto automatically generate fast inference code for ML applications.\nWe show that OptX improves the end-to-end performance of real-world ML inference pipelines curated\nfrom major data science competitions by up to 16x without statistically significant loss of accuracy.",

To\nprevent errors, ML engineering teams monitor and continuously improve these\nmodels.  We propose a new abstraction, model assertions, that adapts the\nclassical use of program assertions as a way to monitor and improve ML models.\nModel assertions are arbitrary functions over the model's input and output that\nindicates when errors may be occurring.  For example, a developer may write an\nassertion that an object's class should stay the same across frames of video.\nOnce written, these assertions can be used both for runtime monitoring and for\nimproving a model at training time.  In particular, we show that at runtime,\nmodel assertions can find high confidence errors, where a model returns\nthe wrong output with high confidence, which uncertainty-based monitoring\ntechniques would not detect.  We also propose two methods to use model\nassertions at training time.  First, we propose a bandit-based active learning\nalgorithm that can sample from data flagged by assertions and show that it can\nreduce labeling costs by up to 33% over traditional uncertainty-based methods.\nSecond, we propose an API for generating \"consistency assertions\" (e.g., the\nclass change example) and weak labels for inputs where the consistency\nassertions fail, and show that these weak labels can improve relative model\nquality by up to 46%.  We evaluate both algorithms on four real-world tasks\nwith video, LIDAR, and ECG data.",

Scaling cloud-based distributed training faces unique challenges from the hierarchical network topology of the datacenter and the dynamic nature of the multi-tenant environment. Timely training of deep learning models requires effective use of topology-induced locality in the datacenter network. This work proposes PLink, an optimized communication library that probes the physical network and then generates and executes a fitted hierarchical aggregation plan to take advantage of such locality, and evolves the plan to adapt to changing network conditions. PLink needs no support from cloud providers and operates out-of-the-box on unmodified public clouds. PLink serves as a direct plug-in to many training frameworks, delivering up to 2.3x better end-to-end training throughput for popular DL models on Azure and EC2 compared to the state of the art.",
